# Helldiver-Stratagem-Hero-Trainer-WS-4Inch-DSI-LCD

*DISCLAIMER*

This is a modification on the github repository from nvigneux's Stratagem Hero Trainer: https://github.com/nvigneux/Stratagem-Hero-Trainer
I do not own nor created this software, I only modified it to improve the ease of use with it on a Waveshare 4" DSI LCD combined with a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.
So full credit for the creation of this software goes to them!

This Github repository was made to use with the hardware mentioned above, for cosplay purposes! the 4" DSI LCD is just the right size to use it as a in real life 'Tac-Pad' from within the game Helldivers 2!
